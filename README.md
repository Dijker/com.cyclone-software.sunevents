## Change Log:

### v.0.1.1
Improved Localization

### v.0.1.0
App was refused at app-store. Rebuild app partly but leave the dynamic completion list in it because you can easily at your own events.

### v 0.0.8
Complete rebuild of the app. Also rename it from Sunrise to SunEvents. The old app will not further developed and this app can replace the old SunRise app. The reason for this is that your existing workflows will not brake and you can change whenever you like. 

### v 0.0.6
added 'and' cards (with offset), removed offset from trigger cards as this cannot function correctly currently.

### v 0.0.5
fixed issue why triggers didn't work sometimes

### v 0.0.4
- small changes and update to appstore
- Image created by 4tetra4! Thanks!

### v 0.0.3
Added trigger options XX minutes before/after sunset/sunrise etc
Know issue, when you change the offset, the old offset will be affective after the first trigger... Then the new one will be applied.
-10 is 10 minutes earlier, +10 is 10 minutes later then the sunset trigger (f.e.)
default = 0 range -60..60

### v 0.0.2
Fix for possible duplicate triggers.


### v 0.0.1
First release and first app :)
